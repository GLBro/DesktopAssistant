A little pet that roams around the desktop, can perform certain tasks for the user

A Houndify client is required, paste your own client id and client key into a .env file
A database called chat.db is also required, simply create the database and uncomment the #train() in speech.py

Click on the pet to active voice commands, this is successful if it is alerted

Functions include:
    Search the web with the phrase "search ......"
    Display an image with the phrase "show me ......"
    Play a video from youtube with the phrase "play ......"
    Tell a joke with the phrase "joke"

Enjoy!
